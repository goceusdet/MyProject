  Scenario Outline: Verify user can contact Sales Representative by filling out all form-fields with data
    #Given user is on "stryker" page (this is handled by custom @ui hook in Hooks class)
    #And user is on a "Contact" navigation menu window
    #And user clicks on "North America" continent
    And user clicks on LEARN MORE "<buttonType>"
    And user is on "<pageName>" page
    And user fills out form "<first name>" "<last name>" "<hospital/organization>" "<title/specialty>" "<email address>" "<phone number>" "<country>" "<city>" "<state>" "<zipcode>" "<message>"
    #And user clicks "submit" button (mock)
    And user captures UI confirmation message
    And user sends POST request with all filled out form-fields to endpoint "/content/stryker/us/en/endoscopy/contact"
    Then api "messageStatus" response field should be "Success"
