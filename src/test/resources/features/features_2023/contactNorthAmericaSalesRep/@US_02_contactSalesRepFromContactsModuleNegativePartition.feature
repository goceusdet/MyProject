    Given user is on "stryker" page
    And user is on a "Contact" navigation menu window
    And user clicks on "North America" continent


  @TC_03 @US_02 @api @ui
  Scenario Outline: Verify user can not contact Sales Representative by submitting an empty form
    #Given user is on "stryker" page (this is handled by custom @ui hook in Hooks class)
    #And user is on a "Contact" navigation menu window
    #And user clicks on "North America" continent
    And user clicks on LEARN MORE "<buttonType>"
    And user is on "<pageName>" page
    #And user clicks "submit" button
    And user captures UI confirmation message
    And user sends POST request with empty fields to endpoint "/content/stryker/us/en/endoscopy/contact"
    Then api "messageStatus" response field should be "Failed"
    And api "message" should match UI confirmation message

      | endoscopy      | endoscopy       |
